            <h2>Why Emmen ?</h2>
            <p>
                The city of Emmen is home to around 56,000 people, meanwhile the entire municipality of Emmen is home to
                107,000 people. The city itself is a prime example of a planned city, it arose from several small farming
                and peat-harvesting communities which have dotted the province of Drenthe since the Middles Ages. The expansion
                of the town did not happen until after World War II. Suburbs were built around the old city centre starting
                with Emmermeer directly to the north, and followed to the south-east by Angelslo. There are a few historic landmarks
                left within the town, but those few include the church on the market square, where it has been standing since
                the Middle Ages, the court of law building, dating from the beginning of the twentieth century, and the post office
                from the same time. In the town's center an earthwork by Robert Smithson, "Broken Circle/Spiral Hill", may be found.
                Emmen has an advanced public transport system with many lines, stops and frequent busses, some of which go to cities like Groningen,
                Assen and Meppen in Germany, however it lacks in train connections since it only has a connection to the city of Zwolle.
                The most famous attraction in Emmen is the city zoo, Wildlands, currently taking 22 hectares of land, with future plans
                to expand it to 45 hectars. It opened on the 25th of March in 2016 and it replaced the previous zoo, it features four
                main areas : Jungola - a jungle themed section, Serenga - an African savanna section, Nortica - a cold section and Animazia
                - a sea/aquarium section, in total the zoo has around 80 types of animals. In its first year the zoo attracted 1,6 million visitors.

                <h2>Why Netherlands ?</h2>
                <p>
                    The Netherlands ranks as one of the best places in the European Union to live and study,
                    offering very high standards of life and highly appreciated education. The dutch methods of
                    teaching are very advanced, involving interactive learning, working in teams, lots of practical
                    work and are student centered. Moreover, degrees by dutch universities are recognised and welcomed
                    all over the world because they meet worldwide accepted standards. International students of over 160
                    different nationalities are welcome here since there is a high choice of programs thought in English
                    and around 90% of the dutch people speak English. Pricing is quite acceptable - 2000&euro; for students
                    coming from a country in the European Union and 8000&euro; for non-european students. After students
                    finish their studies here they can find a job in one of many big and international companies like Philips,
                    Heineken, Shell, DAF, etc. All universities in the Netherlands have fraternities that are run by students for
                    students, they organise events like sports game, festivals, trips, parties and include many internationally
                    oriented activities like showing of a meal from your home country. Dutch people in general are very friendly and crime rates are
                    very low.
