			<p class="why__text--p">
                The city of Emmen is home to around 56,000 people, meanwhile, 
                the entire municipality of Emmen is home to 107,000 people. 
                The city itself is a prime example of a planned city, it arose 
                from several small farming and peat-harvesting communities which 
                have dotted the province of <b>Drenthe</b> since the Middles Ages.
            </p>
			<p class="why__text--p">
                The expansion of the town did not happen until after World War II. 
                Suburbs were built around the old city center starting with <b>Emmermeer</b> 
                directly to the north and followed to the south-east by <b>Angelslo</b>.
            </p>
			<h3>Sights to see:</h3>
			<p class="why__text--p">
                There are a couple of historic landmarks left within the town, they
                include the <b>church</b> on the market square, where it has 
                been standing since the Middle Ages, the <b>court of law building</b>, 
                dating from the beginning of the twentieth century, and the <b>post
                office</b> from the same time. 
            </p>
			<p class="why__text--p">
                Emmen also has an advanced public transport system with multiple lines, 
                stops and frequent buses, some of which go to cities like 
                <b>Groningen, Assen, and Meppen</b> in Germany.
            </p>
			<h3>Wildlands</h3>
			<p class="why__text--p">

                plans to expand it to 45 hectares. It opened on the 25th of 
                March in 2016 replacing the previous zoo.

                <h2>Why Netherlands ?</h2>
                <p class="why__text--p">
                    The Netherlands is one of the best places in Europe to live and study,	
                    offering very high standards of living and high quality education.
					Dutch people, in general, are friendly and welcoming.
				</p>
				<p class="why__text--p">
                    The Dutch methods of teaching are advanced and innovative. These methods include learning by doing, working in teams,
					and are generally focused on helping students become proffessionals in their chosen fields.
					
				</p>
				<p class="why__text--p">
					Moreover, degrees by Dutch universities are recognized 
                    and welcomed all over the world.
				</p>
				<p class="why__text--p">
                    After students finish their studies here they can find a job in one of the many and international companies like <b>Philips, 
                    Sony, Shell, and DAF</b>.
				</p>
				<p class="why__text--p">	
					Universities in the Netherlands have fraternities that are run by students for students!
                    They organize events like sports games, festivals, trips and parties. Some of these events have a focus on connecting nationalites,
                    for example: preparing a meal from your home country.
