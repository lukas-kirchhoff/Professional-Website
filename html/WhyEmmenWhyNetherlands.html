            <h2>Why Emmen ?</h2>
            <p>
                The city of Emmen is home to around 56,000 people, meanwhile, 
                the entire municipality of Emmen is home to 107,000 people. 
                The city itself is a prime example of a planned city, it arose 
                from several small farming and peat-harvesting communities which 
                have dotted the province of <b>Drenthe</b> since the Middles Ages.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                The expansion of the town did not happen until after World War II. 
                Suburbs were built around the old city center starting with <b>Emmermeer</b> 
                directly to the north and followed to the south-east by <b>Angelslo</b>.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                There are a couple of historic landmarks left within the town, they
                include the <b>church</b> on the market square, where it has 
                been standing since the Middle Ages, the <b>court of law building</b>, 
                dating from the beginning of the twentieth century, and the <b>post
                office</b> from the same time. 
            </p><br>
            <p>
                In the town's center an earthwork <b>"Broken Circle/Spiral Hill"</b>, may be found.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Emmen has an advanced public transport system with multiple lines, 
                stops and frequent buses, some of which go to cities like 
                <b>Groningen, Assen, and Meppen</b> in Germany, however, it lacks in 
                train connections since it only has a connection to the city of 
                <b>Zwolle</b>. 
            </p><br>
            <p>
                The most famous attraction in Emmen is the city zoo: <b>Wildlands</b>, 
                which in its first year attracted 1,6 million visitors.
                In total Wildlands has around 80 types of animals, with ample space for all of them:
                The entire zoo is currently 22 hectares large, with future 
                plans to expand it to 45 hectares. It opened on the 25th of 
                March in 2016 replacing the previous zoo.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                It features four main areas : 
                <ul>
                    <li>Jungola - a jungle themed section</li>
                    <li>Serenga - an African savanna section</li> 
                    <li>Nortica - a cold section</li>
                    <li>Animazia - a sea/aquarium section</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

                <h2>Why Netherlands ?</h2>
                <p>
                    The Netherlands ranks as one of the best places in the European Union to live and study,	
                    offering very high standards of life and highly appreciated education. 
                    The Dutch methods of teaching are very advanced, involving interactive learning, working in teams, 
                    lots of practical work and are student-centered. Moreover, degrees by Dutch universities are recognized 
                    and welcomed all over the world because they meet worldwide accepted standards. International students of over 160 
                    different nationalities are welcome here since there is a high choice of programs thought in English 
                    and around 90% of the Dutch people speak English. Pricing is quite acceptable - 2000&euro; 
                    for students coming from a country in the European Union and 8000&euro; for non-EU students. 
                    After students finish their studies here they can find a job in one of many big and international companies like Philips, 
                    Heineken, Shell, DAF, etc. All universities in the Netherlands have fraternities that are run by students for students, 
                    they organize events like sports games, festivals, trips, parties and include many internationally oriented activities
                    like showing off a meal from your home country. Dutch people, in general, 
                    are very friendly and crime rates are very low.
